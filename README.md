## Introduction

Logsort is a novel practical in-place stable O(n log n) quicksort.  The algorithm uses O(log n) space, hence the name, which many consider to be in-place despite not being the optimal O(1).  Unlike well-known in-place stable sorts, such as std::stable_sort, which are O(n log² n), Logsort is asymptotically optimal.

To see Logsort's practical performance, jump to [Results](https://github.com/aphitorite/Logsort#Results).

**Usage:** define `VAR` element type and `CMP` comparison function.

## Motivation

O(n log n) in-place stable sorting is hard to achieve for sorting algorithms.  Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort are stable and in-place but suboptimal.  Efficient sorts, such as Quicksort and Heapsort, are in-place and O(n log n) but unstable.  

One class of sorting algorithms that achieve both in-place, stability, and O(n log n) time is Block Sort (a.k.a. Block Merge Sorts), such as [Wikisort](https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/WikiSort) and [Grailsort](https://github.com/Mrrl/GrailSort), which are in-place merge sorts.  However, they are incredibly complicated and hard to implement.  In addition, in-place stable partitioning is a rather obscure problem in sorting.  Katajainen & Pasanen 1992 describes an O(1) space O(n) time partitioning algorithm, but it's only of theoretical interest.

Logsort is a new sorting algorithm that aims to provide a simple and practical O(n log n) in-place stable sort implementation like alternatives such as Block Sort.  The algorithm uses a novel O(n) in-place stable partitioning algorithm different than Katajainen & Pasanen 1992 and borrows ideas from [Aeos Quicksort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YTl2VJnQ4s) (stable quicksort with O(sqrt n) size blocking).  By sorting recursively using this partition, we get an O(n log n) sorting algorithm.

## Algorithm

Partitioning is analogous to sorting an array of 0's and 1's, where elements smaller than the pivot are 0 and elements larger are 1. (Munro et al. 1990)  Logsort sorts 0's and 1's stably in O(n) time and O(log n) space via its partition.

In brief, Logsort groups 0's and 1's elements into blocks of size O(log n) using its available space.  By swapping elements among the 0 and 1 blocks, it assigns a unique index to each block.  The algorithm then performs an LL block swap partition on the blocks which preserves the order of one partition but not the other.  Using the assigned indices from earlier, Logsort restores the order of the blocks in the scrambled partition.  Lastly, the leftover 0's not divisible by the block length are shifted into place, and the Logsort partition is completed in O(n) time and O(log n) space.

The four phases of the partition algorithm in more detail along with proofs:
1. [Grouping elements into blocks](https://github.com/aphitorite/Logsort#grouping-phase)
2. [Bit encoding the blocks](https://github.com/aphitorite/Logsort#bit-encoding)
3. [Swapping the blocks](https://github.com/aphitorite/Logsort#swapping-the-blocks)
4. [Sorting the blocks](https://github.com/aphitorite/Logsort#sorting-the-blocks) (+ [cleanup](https://github.com/aphitorite/Logsort#cleaning-up))

The entire partition is implemented in about 100 lines of C code: [logPartition.c](https://github.com/aphitorite/Logsort/blob/main/logPartition.c)

## Grouping phase

Given an unordered list of 0's and 1's, we group them into blocks of a fixed size where each block contains either only 0's or 1's.  Given two buckets of B extra space, one can easily group blocks of size B (Katajainen & Pasanen 1992):

```
Grouping blocks of size 2:

        ↓ move to ones bucket
array: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
zeros: [ ,  ]
 ones: [ ,  ]
 
           ↓ move to zeros bucket
array: [ , 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
zeros: [ ,  ]
 ones: [1,  ]
 
              ↓ move to ones bucket
array: [ ,  , 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
zeros: [0,  ]
 ones: [1,  ]
 
array: [ ,  ,  , 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]      
zeros: [0,  ]
 ones: [1, 1] ← ones bucket full: output back into array

        ↓  ↓ first block created: continue looping
array: [1, 1,  , 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
zeros: [0,  ]
 ones: [ ,  ] 
 ```

It's almost guaranteed we end up with partially filled buckets at the end of this phase.  In that case, we output the 0 elements followed by the 1's at the end of the array.

```
                          ↓ output zeros
array: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1,  ,  ]
zeros: [0,  ]
 ones: [1,  ]

                             ↓ output ones
array: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,  ]
zeros: [ ,  ]
 ones: [1,  ]


array: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

       ┌──── blocks ────┐ ↓ leftover zeros
       [1, 1][0, 0][1, 1][0][1]
```

At the end of the phase, we are left with some leftover zeros that don't make a complete block.  We handle them in the very last step of the partition.

Logsort's O(log n) space usage comes from grouping blocks of size O(log n), and this will be important in the encoding phase.  In the actual implementation, Logsort uses a space optimization from Aeos Quicksort which only needs one bucket instead of two. (Anonymous0726 2021)  Like Wikisort and Grailsort, Logsort's external buffer size can be configured, given it's at least Ω(log n).

> Since each element is moved a constant amount of times, once to the bucket and once back to the array, the grouping phase is O(n) regardless of block size but requires O(block size) extra space.

## Bit encoding

0's and 1's can also be concatenated to make binary numbers, so we can encode numbers in blocks by swapping elements between 0 blocks and 1 blocks.  Decoding a number in a block requires a scan of the block which costs O(log n) comparisons.  Since Logsort's blocks are O(log n) in size, there are enough bits to assign a unique index to each block.

> There are at most O(n/log n) encodable blocks which require log(n/log n) = O(log n) bits to represent a number range from 0 to O(n/log n).

```
Encode 11 = 0b1101:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 └───────────────┘
    └───────────────┘          ← swap the following
          └───────────────┘
          
┌─── 11 ───┐    ┌── ~11 ───┐
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
             ↑               ↑ 
             last bit reserved to determine 0 or 1 block
```

Using this, the encoding phase encodes every pair of 0 and 1 block with a unique index.  We maintain two iterators: one for 0 blocks and 1 blocks respectively:

```
Encode blocks:

 (0)  (0)
[ 0 ][ 1 ][ 1 ][ 1 ][ 0 ][ 1 ][ 0 ][ 1 ]
└───┘└───┘ encode 0

 (0)  (0)  (1)       (1)
[ 0 ][ 1 ][ 1 ][ 1 ][ 0 ][ 1 ][ 0 ][ 1 ]
          └───┘     └───┘ encode 1

 (0)  (0)  (1)  (2)  (1)       (2)
[ 0 ][ 1 ][ 1 ][ 1 ][ 0 ][ 1 ][ 0 ][ 1 ]
               └───┘          └───┘ encode 2 and finish
```

In this example, there were fewer 0 blocks, so all 0 blocks get encoded leaving some 1 blocks untouched.  These leftover blocks will be dealt with in the swapping phase.

> Encoding an index costs O(log n) swaps.  Since each block is size O(log n), there are O(n/log n) blocks, so this phase is O(n/log n) \* O(log n) = O(n).

## Swapping the blocks

Once the blocks are encoded, we swap the blocks belonging to the larger partition.  In our example, there are more 1 blocks than 0 blocks so we scan the blocks' reserved bit and swap the 1 blocks to the right into their correct place:

```
Swap blocks:

 (0)   (0)   (1)   (2)   (1)         (2)
[ 0a ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 0b ][ 1d ][ 0c ][ 1e ]
                              └────┘└────┘ block swap

 (0)   (0)   (1)   (2)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
                  └────┘      └────┘ block swap

 (0)   (0)   (1)   (2)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 0c ][ 0b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
            └────┘      └────┘ block swap

 (0)   (0)   (1)   (2)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 1a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
      └────┘      └────┘ block swap

 (0)   (2)   (1)   (0)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0c ][ 0b ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
                         (finished block swapping)
```

Swapping blocks in this fashion preserves the order of the 1 blocks.  If there were more 0 blocks, we would swap them to the left.  In this example, after swapping, the 1's partition is stably ordered.  However, the order of the 0 blocks are now scrambled.  Using the encoded indices in the 0 blocks, we can reorder them stably in the sorting phase.

> Each block in the phase is swapped once.  Since each block swap costs O(log n) swaps and there are at most O(n/log n) blocks swapped, the swapping phase is O(n/log n) \* O(log n) = O(n).

## Sorting the blocks

Reordering the scrambled blocks is quite easy: simply iterate across the blocks.  If the current block's index is not equal to the iterator, block swap the current block to the read index.  Repeat this step until the current block's index matches the iterator and move on to the next block.

```
Sort blocks:

 (0)←  (2)   (1)   (0)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0c ][ 0b ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
└────┘ 0th block == 0 ? -> Yes: go to next block

 (0)   (2)←  (1)   (0)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0c ][ 0b ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
      └────┘ 1st block == 2 ? -> No: swap with 2nd block

 (0)   (1)   (2)   (0)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
      └────┘└────┘

 (0)   (1)←  (2)   (0)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
      └────┘ 1st block == 1 ? -> Yes: go to next block

 (0)   (1)   (2)←  (0)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
            └────┘ 2nd block == 2 ? -> Yes: finish
```

In pseudocode:

```
for each index from 0 to blocks.count - 1:
	current = blocks[index].decode()
	while current != index:
		block swap blocks[current] and blocks[index]
		current = blocks[index].decode()
```

In our example, we swapped the 1 blocks and sorted the 0 blocks.  However, if there were more 0 blocks, we have to swap the 0 blocks and sort the 1 blocks.  When decoding indices of 1 blocks, we need to invert the results first before processing:

```
for each index from 0 to blocks.count - 1:
	current = ~blocks[index].decode()
	while current != index:
		block swap blocks[current] and blocks[index]
		current = ~blocks[index].decode()
```

(In the actual implementation, we XOR with a bit mask of either all 0's or all 1's.)

> Each time a block is swapped, it ends up in its final destination, therefore a block is swapped at most once.  The blocks are also decoded at most twice: once per block swap and once per iterated block.  
> 
> Combined, the operations on a block are O(log n).  Since there are at most O(n/log n) scrambled blocks, the sorting phase is O(n/log n) \* O(log n) = O(n).

### Cleaning up

After the sorting phase, the blocks are now partitioned stably in O(n) time.  However, some elements between blocks are still swapped from the encoding phase, and we want to restore the original states of the blocks.  Since they are in order, we can easily "uncode" them, by encoding them with the same index, to complete the partition on the blocks.

```
Uncode blocks:

 (0)   (1)   (2)   (0)   (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
└────┘            └────┘ uncode 0 (encode 0)

       (1)   (2)         (1)   (2)
[ 0a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
      └────┘            └────┘ uncode 1 (encode 1)

             (2)               (2)
[ 0a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
            └────┘            └────┘ uncode 2 (encode 2)

[ 0a ][ 0b ][ 0c ][ 1a ][ 1b ][ 1c ][ 1d ][ 1e ]
[       0        ][             1              ]

blocks and underlying elements partitioned stably!
```

We are not done yet and still have a leftover chunk of 0's from the grouping phase.  Simply copy the 0 leftovers, shift the 1's partition to the right, and copy the leftovers back:

```
Clean up:

[0 0 0 0 0][1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1][0 0 0][1 1 1]
                                    └─────┘ copy out
                                    
[0 0 0 0 0][1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]       [1 1 1]
           └───────────────────────┘ shift --->

[0 0 0 0 0]       [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1][1 1 1]
           └─────┘ copy in

[0 0 0 0 0][0 0 0][1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1][1 1 1]
└─────── 0 ──────┘└────────────── 1 ─────────────┘

partition complete!
```

Finally, we've stably partitioned the list in O(n) time and O(log n) space.

> There are O(n/log n) pairs of blocks that need to be uncoded.  Since each uncoding operation is O(log n), it costs O(n/log n) \* O(log n) = O(n) operations.
> 
>  Copying the leftovers and shifting the 1's partition is O(n) + O(log n) = O(n).

## Results

An O(n log n) in-place stable sort in theory sounds great, but how does it compare against existing sorts?  In the following benchmarks, we test Logsort's practicality against four other stable sorting algorithms:

- [**Grailsort**](https://github.com/Mrrl/GrailSort) +512 aux (Block Merge Sort)
- [**Octosort**](https://github.com/scandum/octosort) +512 aux (Block Merge Sort, optimized [Wikisort](https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/WikiSort))
- [**Sqrtsort**](https://github.com/Mrrl/SqrtSort) +SqrtN aux (Block Merge Sort)
- [**Blitsort**](https://github.com/scandum/blitsort) +512 aux (Fast Rotate Merge/Quick Sort, O(n log² n))

All sorts are compiled using `gcc -O3` and sorting a random linear distribution of 32-bit integers containing N unique, Sqrt(N) unique, and 4 unique values respectively.  The average time among 100 trials is recorded.

## Concluding remarks

Grailsort, Octosort, and Sqrtsort used branched comparisons in merging.  Logsort was optimized with branchless comparisons similar to [Fluxsort](https://github.com/scandum/fluxsort/) which greatly improved its performance. (40% increase in speed!)

Unlike Block Merge Sorts, Logsort relies on its bit encoding to store information rather than distinct values.  This avoids any overhead in a key collection algorithm; we see this happening with Grailsort spending O(n log n) comparisons finding SqrtN uniques.

Being a stable quicksort, Logsort naturally performs well on data with few uniques boasting a O(n log u) complexity.  However, Octosort and Blitsort beat Logsort on a data size of 16M with 4 uniques despite having a complexity of O(n log n log u).  This is likely due to Logsort's poorer access patterns and overhead compared to simple merges with rotations.

Logsort's main rival, Blitsort, is an optimized Rotate Merge/Quick Sort which uses rotations to merge/partition but has a suboptimal O(n log² n) complexity.  Despite this, Rotate Merge is known to beat the optimal Block Merge owing to its simplicity, good locality, and low overhead.

In the benchmarks, Logsort remained competitive with Blitsort on 16k and 1M integers and even beat Blitsort on 16M integers with its superior time complexity.  Unlike Blitsort, however, Logsort is not optimized to be an adaptive sort, and this comparison is only on random data.  A hybrid between a rotate partition and blocked partition is also a good idea, but such an optimization is left to the reader.

With further improvements, it's likely that stable O(n log n) in-place sorting has practical application outside of theory.  It's worth noting that Logsort's application is quite galactic, only seeing benefits on lengths in the tens of millions.  However, despite Logsort's simplicity compared to Block Merge Sorts, these algorithms remain fairly complicated compared to their unstable counterparts.
